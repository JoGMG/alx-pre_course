# 0x01. Git
## Requirements
- A `README.md` file at the root of the `alx-pre_course` repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. `0x01-git`), describing what this project is about
- Do not use **GitHub’s web UI**, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
- Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else
## Tasks
### 0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
Step 0 - Create an account on GitHub [if you do not have one already]<br>
Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token on Github<br>
Step 2 - Update your profile on the Intranet<br>
Step 3 - Create your first repository<br>
Step 4 - Open the sandbox<br>
Step 5 - Clone your repository<br>
Step 6 - Create the README.md and push the modifications<br>
### 1. Repo-session
Create a new directory called `0x01-git` in your `alx-pre_course` repo.

Make sure you include a non empty `README.md` in your directory:

- at the root of your repository `alx-pre_course`
- AND in the directory `0x01-git`

And important part: **Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.**
### 2. Coding fury road
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a `README.md`. It’s time to code!

- Inside `0x01-git`:

  - Create these directories at the root of your project: `bash`, `c`, `js`
  - Create these empty files:
    - `c/c_is_fun.c`
    - `js/main.js`
    - `js/index.js`
  - Create a file `bash/alx` with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "ALX"`
  - Create a file `bash/school` with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "School"`
  - Add all these new files to git
  - Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
